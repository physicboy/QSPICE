# QSPICE

This is my own flavor for frequency response analysis implementation in Qspice.

From my test it is faster than the built in FRA implementation in Qspice.
Additionally all the algorithm is fully opened for everyone to learn/copy/modify

The code is free for everyone to use or modify/improve without any warranty.

You can start by downloading the whole folder and open LPF.qsch, then run the simulation and explore from there
