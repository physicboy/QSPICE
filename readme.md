Hi All,

Welcome to Arief's Github repo on [Qspice](https://www.qorvo.com/design-hub/design-tools/interactive/qspice/).
Here you will find some solutions that I have implemented in my own Qspice workflow.

Relatively speaking, some of my work/contribution that maybe most useful are:
1. [Digital control algorithm implementation in varying complexity and speed benefit](https://github.com/physicboy/QSPICE/tree/main/PWM_example_SRbuck).
2. [Practical FRA block that closely replicate physical FRA measurement](https://github.com/physicboy/QSPICE/tree/main/FRA_project).
3. [General purpose PWM comparator](https://github.com/physicboy/QSPICE/tree/main/Multipurpose_PWM), etc.

For general discussions, please check the [Qspice user forums](https://forum.qorvo.com/c/qspice/).
